              This module is an important baseline to have for learning JS by
              showing what programming is and the importance of pseudocode. It
              demonstrates the use of aspects like strings, conditional
              statements, logical equivalence and procedures that can be used to
              create repetition in code and lists with the help of math and
              variables. The biggest impact this module had on me was that it
              gave me a baseline and showed me the similarities and differences
              from C++ which I had learnt in grade 11. I can continue to learn
              by building on these basic concepts in order to create more
              complex projects by combining them together, learning more complex
              aspects like object oriented programming by making sure I use them
              as an everyday habit when coding.

              This module is an important aspect for getting a foundation in JS
              and is an extension for more complex projects from the
              ‘AP®︎/College Computer Science Principles Programming’ module. It
              teaches important aspects such as, conditionals, functions, scope,
              arrays, loops, iterators and object oriented programming. Object
              oriented programming is what I found most impactful, because it
              allows for an expandable program to be created with classes in
              order to modify the functions of variables that are contained in
              the specific class. I can continue to learn from this course by
              incorporating object oriented programming as an everyday habit,
              create refactorings on the projects of others in order to use
              object oriented programming to expand their project and continue
              to use important programming practices by developing more
              complexly structured projects. Also, it is important for me to
              continue to develop my JS abilities through other languages that
              can easily be learnt after JS like TypeScript or to continue using
              libraries like the p5.js library.

              This module teaches how to create elements and structuring them
              with attributes, tables, forms, and semantic HTML in order to
              create a clear front end. HTML and CSS are important languages
              that are complementary to JS. This was the most significant aspect
              of the course for me. I was able to learn how to use HTML/CSS in
              order to combine it with JS to create an appealing front end to a
              project, but also a robust back end, helping me create more
              meaningful, structured and complex projects. In this era where the
              internet and web are very impactful, having the knowledge of
              HTML/CSS is second to none. I can continue to improve my learning
              by creating complex projects that require a front and back end,
              but also continuing my education by using websites like W3Schools
              and StackOverflow.

              This module demonstrates the importance of creative coding with
              animations, interactions and media. The most impactful part of
              this module for me was to be able to combine all of these aspects
              together in order to start creating more complexly structured
              programs. It was the first time I was able to experience creating
              a program that was dynamic and offered a more complex visual
              aspect. I was then able to incorporate this knowledge into other
              modules like the creative computation art show, combining these
              visual aspects with object oriented code, but most notably the
              hackathon where my group made a musical reaction game with moving
              notes, combining coherently many complex aspects of object
              oriented code and this module. Also, it enabled me to use the
              p5.js library which expanded my coding knowledge and proved to be
              useful in future projects. I can continue to learn from this module
              by pushing myself to create more complex game models in my free
              time, post secondary or even try to pursue game development as a
              career. This will force me to visit third party educational
              websites like W3Schools and StackOverflow, and also to use
              debugging software when dealing with complex code.

              This module focuses on creating natural simulations in CS by
              combining many math concepts that are found in nature like
              randomness, noise, vectors, forces, angular movement, oscillations
              and particle systems. The biggest impact this course had on me was
              the integration of mathematical concepts while programming.
              Concepts, such as trigonometry and vectors are important in this
              simulation because of their ability to control the magnitude or
              direction of an object or the ability to predict the outcome of an
              object's location. In general, this course is very useful to be
              able to learn different ways of simulating an object from nature
              by having information about what it does. This is something that
              can be used in everyday life and far more observable on
              simulations that were made with code making the need for
              simulation very necessary. I can continue to use this to learn as
              a student because I can now use math and nature in order to create
              a computer science program which I can now create programs with
              simulations and I can continue to combine different subjects
              together in order to create a simulation by using computer science
              as a tool. I can also read Dan Shiffman’s book “The Nature of
              Code” to expand my knowledge from this course.

              The Hackathon was an eye opening project where it was possible to
              work in a group and bounce ideas off each other. We were able to
              create a program that was functional and that was geared to the UN
              goal of education which showed us that we are capable of a
              Hackathon and that we can make projects that can be further
              developed because of object oriented programming. It helped us to
              be able to communicate with each other and it helped us solve
              problems that we may have had by evaluating all of our options and
              everyone's ideas to see what is best. We were able to incorporate
              object oriented programming in this project very efficiently,
              because in our project we had music notes playing, in which they
              all had different functions and speed. Object oriented was
              important here because we could expand the music notes which gave
              them different functions. It also introduced us to back end
              programming and how we could have improved the program, by giving
              further statistics to the user in order to learn how to improve
              their score. We could have done this by storing the information in
              an array, then by creating a table or graph in order to
              demonstrate the progress. It can help me to continue to learn as a
              student because now I have the capabilities to work in a group and
              collaborate, which is very useful for computer science in
              university or at a real job or in any subject in general. I can
              also continue to integrate different aspects of code and combine
              them together with object oriented design which was useful in the
              next live coding challenge project but will also be necessary in
              other projects that I may want to pursue after this class.

              The most significant impact this module had on me was to be able
              to take someone else’s code and be able to understand what each
              line of the code meant and to be able to explain it to someone
              else in order for them to understand. Also the code refactoring
              showed me how to add onto someone else’s code without starting
              from scratch, and finishing what they have begun. I think that the
              most important part of this project was utilizing object oriented
              code, because in both of my creative refactorings for the live
              coding challenge and the computation art show, I was able to add
              more features from the classes that I created which contained
              certain characteristics. This code could then be easily given to
              someone else to change because the way classes contain
              characteristics, those characteristics could easily be added on or
              new characteristics could be created passing them down to more and
              more people to change. I think the main way I can continue to
              learn computer science from this is that it has given me the
              ability to create multiple refactorings and improve my abilities
              with each project and to continue to always improve my projects.
              It will also help when transitioning into a real job where code
              will be passed down from different people and I will need to add
              new features, or debug the code.

              This module teaches SQL by showing the aspects of manipulation,
              queries, aggregate functions, and how to create multiple tables.
              Queries were the most impactful part of this module as queries are
              the most important aspect of SQL, as it is what helps you sort
              through a table and filter a specific data that you want to
              examine. They are also important to store and update database
              information such as INSERT and UPDATE commands, which is very
              important for back end development and needs to have an embedded
              database, in order to be able to filter via the SELECT command
              through the information and give the computer enough information
              in order to provide a suitable front end page for the user to be
              able to process. Without SQL it would be very time consuming to
              filter, store and update tables and databases, because there would
              be no way of selecting all of the data types that you are looking
              for and filtering or changing them at once. It will help me to
              improve my learning of computer science, because now I will be
              able to understand and use different flavours of SQL, like
              PostgreSQL, MySql T-Sql. SQL syntax is 95% common for those
              flavours and about 5% syntax is flavour specific.

              This module shows the relation between the internet and computer
              innovation. It demonstrates how both can help improve one another
              and depend on each other. The computer innovations part showed
              innovations in communication, collaboration, crowdsourcing and
              monitoring, whereas the internet showed aspects like connecting
              networks, addressing the internet, routing with redundancy,
              transporting packets, web protocols, scalable systems, the
              internet protocol suite, open protocol development and the digital
              divide. The digital divide is the most impactful aspect, because
              it shows the socioeconomic divide that this world has for the
              access of technology to digital education. Some of the factors
              that affect this are different age groups, races, geographical
              locations, economical backgrounds or education opportunities.
              Without giving everyone an equal opportunity, it is impossible to
              develop computer innovation and the internet to the fullest extent
              because not everyone that can be impactful will have the
              opportunity of contributing the innovation or testing it. I can
              continue to learn by staying current in the industry and taking
              note of emerging technologies in order to utilise them in my
              projects.

              This module teaches how with the use of data analysis, simulations
              and online data security can be strongly developed by continuing
              to innovate. The most impactful part of this module was that it
              showed me how useful just something like data could be,
              especially, when collected accurately, and used effectively
              through analysis and simulations. It was interesting to see the
              aspects of data tools, big data, and how there are even biases in
              computer technologies like machine learning. I liked how the
              negative parts of technologies like machine learning were shown
              because the data that is given could not be diverse enough
              creating bias. Furthermore, when this data is used effectively
              technologies like facial recognition or COVID-19 caes, deaths and
              hospitalizations simulations could be created. I can continue to
              learn by creating large scale projects that are used from a
              database that was collected and filter through the data with a
              language like SQL, even by doing further research on the
              importance of information or applying more mathematical concepts
              in my program, such as trends and correlations to source through
              data effectively.
